# The count is the verdict; a clock on this workload would be measuring the
# box. The checksum and the accepted count are printed so a compiler that
# removed the work, or a change that altered a verdict, shows up as a changed
# number rather than as a good one.
#
# THE FRESHNESS CHECK IS NOT OPTIONAL. Its sibling in rusty_rtos_heap was
# wrong once -- it profiled a stale binary left by an earlier run and reported
# an identical count across a real source change, which is exactly what a
# stale binary looks like.
